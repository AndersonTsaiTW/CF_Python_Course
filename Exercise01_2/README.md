# Exercise 1.2

Step 1: For a structure named recipe_1 that contains the keys name (str), cooking_time (int), and ingredients (list), I have chosen to use a dictionary. A dictionary stores and accesses data using keys, which makes it easier to retrieve specific values directly by their keys rather than relying on their order. Additionally, dictionaries are flexible and well-suited for representing structured data like a recipe with multiple attributes.

Step 3: I would choose a list to create the structure. A list has a sequential nature, allowing multiple recipes to be stored and modified as needed. While a tuple can also store data in sequence, the data inside a tuple is immutable and cannot be modified. This is why a list is the best choice for all_recipes.
